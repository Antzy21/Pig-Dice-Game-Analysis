# Pig-Dice-Game-Analysis

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

'Run Pig' folder contains Code for running the game.

'Strategies' folder contains strategies to run for the game.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Each other file is a function that calls on other ones in such an order that is notated as such:
e.g: Function 1 <- (Function 2, Function 3 <- Function 4)
Where Function 1 calls on Function 2 and Function 3, and within that, function 3 calls on function 4.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Finding probability of strategies winning against eachother:
Probability_Matrices <- (Matrices, Strategies_to_Matrices)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Optimising a Strategy against another attempt 1:
OptimisingVs <- Probability_Matrices <- (Matrices, Strategies_to_Matrices)

Repetative Optimisations:
OptimisingVs_Iterative <- OptimisingVs <- Probability_Matrices <- (Matrices, Strategies_to_Matrices)
